-WARD road tests
-comments are delenated on both sides by the hash symbol
-comments are multiline and continue until another hash is found
-all tests other than the last must end with '@' before the next test can begin
-the final test must NOT end with '@' or the parser will crash
-some tests are commented out. This is because the parser can not handle some of the parameters used
-parameters that are still in progress include: distance
